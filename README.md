# Minesweeper Project
## About the project / Game rules
For this project you will create a basic version on the classic minesweeper game. The game does not have to have all of the traditional rules in place as we do not want you to spend too much time on it.  The game grid should be an 8 by 8 with 10 mines randomly placed on it. The game does need to support left click to select the cell and right click to mark a cell as having a bomb. Upon selecting a cell, there should be logic for what number to display, displaying a blank cell, or showing the bomb and losing the game as applicable.
There are online minesweeper games already created, we ask that you do not copy directly from them as we are using this to evaluate your coding skills. You may use external libraries if you like.

## Requirements
* Must use HTML, JavaScript (and/or jQuery), and CSS
*	Must have left and right click events
*	Grid display must update as user interacts with it (show number, blank cell, or bomb)
*	Grid must be 8 x 8 with 10 mines
*	Mines must be randomly placed
*	Will only be tested in Chrome

## Bonus
*	Use all CSS classes instead of inline styling
*	Use all JavaScript/jQuery events instead of inline attributes (e.g. donâ€™t use onclick=)
*	Use Foundation library for some layout, styling, etc. (https://foundation.zurb.com/)
*	When clicking on a blank cell, it auto clicks the surrounding cells
*	Add a clock to keep track of how long it takes to win or lose
*	Add a countdown for number of bombs identified
*	Add a new game button to start over without refreshing
